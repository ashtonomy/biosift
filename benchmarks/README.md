# Benchmarks
Contains code to reproduce each of the four benchmarking categories from the original paper. Each subdirectory contains training and evaluation code as well as raw results and any supplementary artifacts. Each of the subdirectories contains an `src` subdirectory with training and evaluation scripts and an `output` directory with run artifacts, where applicable.
