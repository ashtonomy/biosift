# Benchmarks
Contains code to reproduce each of the four benchmarking categories from the original paper. Each subdirectory contains training and evaluation code as well as raw results and any supplementary artifacts. Each of the four subdirectories should contain, at minimum, an `src` subdirectory with training and evaluation scripts.
