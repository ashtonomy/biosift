      "      AGS15E in patients with mUC (NCT01963052). During dose escalation, AGS15E was \n",

      "      Ninety-three patients were recruited, including 33 patients previously treated \n",
      "      with CPIs. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue \n",
      "      (54.8%), nausea (37.6%), and decreased appetite (35.5%). Peripheral neuropathy \n",
      "      and ocular toxicities occurred at doses of >/=0.75 mg/kg. AGS15E increased in a \n",

      "      accumulation was low. Five DLTs occurred from 0.50â€’1.25 mg/kg. The RP2D was \n",
      "      assessed at 1.00 mg/kg; the objective response rate (ORR) was 35.7% at this dose \n",
      "      level. The ORRs in the total population and CPI-exposed subgroup were 18.3% and \n",
      "      27.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: DLTs with AGS15E were observed at 0.75, 1.00, \n",

      "AB  - Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver \n",
      "      cancer, which is among the most lethal tumours. Combination therapy exploits \n",
      "      multiple drugs to target key pathways synergistically to reduce tumour growth. \n",
      "      Isothiocyanates have been shown to possess anticancer potential and to complement \n",
      "      the anticancer activity of other compounds. This study aimed to investigate the \n",
      "      potential of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) to synergise with dasatinib, \n",
      "      improving its anticancer potential in HCC. Methods: MTT, 3D spheroids and \n",
      "      clonogenic assays were used to assess the combination anti-tumour effect in \n",
      "      vitro, whereas a murine syngeneic model was employed to evaluate the combination \n",
      "      efficacy in vivo. DCFDA staining was employed to evaluate the production of \n",
      "      reactive oxygen species (ROS), while flow cytometry and Western blot assays were \n",
      "      used to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the synergistic activiy. Results: \n",
      "      PEITC and dasatinib combination exhibited a synergistic effect in vitro and in \n",

      "AB  - BACKGROUND: TRAIL has emerged as a promising therapeutic target due to its \n",
      "      ability to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing normal \n",
      "      cells. Autophagy, a highly regulated cellular recycling mechanism, is known to \n",
      "      play a cell survival role by providing a required environment for the cell. \n",
      "      Recent studies suggest that autophagy plays a significant role in increasing \n",
      "      TRAIL resistance in certain cancer cells. Thus, regulating autophagy in \n",
      "      TRAIL-mediated cancer therapy is crucial for its role in cancer treatment. \n",
      "      OBJECTIVE: Our study explored whether the antidepressant drug desipramine could \n",
      "      enhance the ability of TRAIL to kill cancer cells by inhibiting autophagy. \n",
      "      METHODS: The effect of desipramine on TRAIL sensitivity was examined in various \n",
      "      lung cancer cell lines. Cell viability was measured by morphological analysis, \n",
      "      trypan blue exclusion, and crystal violet staining. Flow cytometry analysis was \n",
      "      carried out to measure apoptosis with annexin V-PI stained cells. Western \n",
      "      blotting, rtPCR, and immunocytochemistry were carried out to measure autophagy \n",
      "      and death receptor expression. TEM was carried out to detect autophagy \n",
      "      inhibition. RESULTS: Desipramine treatment increased the TRAIL sensitivity in all \n",
      "      lung cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, desipramine treatment induced death \n",
      "      receptor expression to increase TRAIL sensitivity. This effect was confirmed when \n",
      "      the genetic blockade of DR5 reduced the effect of desipramine in enhanced \n",
      "      TRAIL-mediated cell death. Further investigation revealed that desipramine \n",
      "      treatment increased the LC3 and p62 levels, indicating the inhibition of \n",
      "      lysosomal degradation of autophagy. Notably, TRAIL, in combination with either \n",
      "      desipramine or the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, exhibited enhanced \n",
      "      cytotoxicity compared to TRAIL treatment alone. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed \n",
      "      the potential of desipramine to induce TRAIL-mediated cell death by autophagy \n",
      "      impairment. This discovery suggests its therapeutic potential for inducing \n",
